Data engineer/scientist and quantitative researcher with 18 years building systems that extract signal from noise.

My work spans system engineering, ML, data engineering, portfolio analytics, and economic research—always anchored in first-principles thinking and empirical validation. I don't chase narratives that don't survive contact with data.

## Current Work

**Data Engineering & Analytics**  
Leading data platform modernization at Macquarie Group: DBT/Iceberg/Redshift architectures, data governance through DBT & Collier, and observable data pipelines.

**Investment Research**  
Developing quantitative frameworks for portfolio construction and long-term portfolio strategy.

**Systems Thinking**  
Building graph-based intelligence platforms for venture capital analysis and exploring applications of ML/AI to financial domains.

## Background

**Technical:** Data engineering at scale • DBT, Spark, Redshift, Iceberg • ML/AI (graph networks, probabilistic models) • LLMs & Beyond (JEPA) • Modern development (Python, R, AWS) • Blockchain/decentralized systems

**Analytical:** Quantitative finance • Portfolio analytics • Economic time-series analysis • CFA Level 1 • Data governance (BCBS 239, CPG 235)

**Domain Experience:** Financial services • Media/publishing • Healthcare • Renewables/energy • Gaming

## Previous Roles

- Senior Manager/Lead Engineer at Boson Research Advisory (2023-2025) 
- Product Manager at Hydroverse •
- Various roles at Sky News, Fairfax Media, Zynga, Oracle, and startups across Sydney, San Francisco, and Bangalore.

## Published Work

**[Crusade Against Kidney Disease](https://crusadekidneydisease.com/)** (2021)  
Research synthesis on slowing CKD progression through evidence-based interventions. Written after watching family members navigate clinical treatment failures. Not-for-profit.

## Interests

Outside of work: `evolutionary economics`, `self-sustainability`, genetic-based health optimization, and long-term systems thinking.

## Site Philosophy

This site archives my research, notebooks, and projects. It's organized for reference and discovery, not chronology. Everything here prioritizes:

- **Quantitative reasoning** where possible
- **First-principles thinking** where necessary  
- **Skepticism** toward narratives unsupported by data

If you're looking for polished marketing material, this isn't it. If you're looking for working analysis with code and assumptions made explicit, you're in the right place.
