Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when location of Death's Occurrence, Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or"
"Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"

"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Unreliable."
"4. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"

"6. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
"7. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
