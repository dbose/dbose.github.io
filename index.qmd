This site is a working archive — not a feed.

Everything here is oriented toward **truth-seeking through analysis**:  
quantitative reasoning where possible, first-principles thinking where necessary, and skepticism toward narratives that don’t survive contact with data.

## What you’ll find here

### Articles
Essays, market notes, and technical deep dives — written to clarify, not to perform.

### Notebooks
Runnable research with code, charts, and assumptions made explicit.  
Exploratory by design, not polished marketing artefacts.

### Papers
Drafts, PDFs, and reference material — including work that is incomplete, evolving, or deliberately unresolved.

### Projects
Pointers to my GitHub work: tools, models, and systems built to answer specific questions.
